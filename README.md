# Rumor Mill
My teams final project for Level Design and Game Architecture 'Rumor Mill' made in two weeks

## Why'd we make this?
This project was made as a part of Northeasterns Level Design and Game Architecture class. Our game was a game inspired by the feeling of chasing rumors and scary stories around our hometowns as teens. We aimed to create an atmosphere of lightheartedness with moments of tension whenever our characters go to places with "rumors" about them.

## What'd I learn?
This was the first project where I learned about creating "systems" in Unity which would allow designers to create things more easily from the actual editor without having to dive into the code. I created a dialogue system that was extendable to each character or object which allowed us to quickly adjust what was interactable in our scenes and what wasn't and change or add character dialogue easily through the editor.
